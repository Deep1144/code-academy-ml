__Grade:__ **20/20** (see https://github.com/julien-amar/code-academy-ml/issues/1)

## Regression

__LinearRegression:__ a model for understanding the relationship between an input and output numerical variables using a linear regression: `a * x + b`

__Multiple Linear Regression:__ Similar to LinearRegression, but enables to understand the relationship between multiple inputs and output numerical variables using a linear regression: `a1 * x1 + a2 * x2 + ... + an * xn + b`

## Classifier
__Naive Bayes:__ Supervised machine learning algorithm that leverages Bayes' Theorem (probabilistic approach) to make predictions and classifications.

__K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):__ Non-parametric method used for classification. The input consists of the **k** closest training examples in the feature space. 

__K-Nearest Neighbor Regressor (KNNR):__ Similar to KNN, but output the average of the values of its **k** nearest neighbors for a specific feature.

__Support Vector Machines (SVM):__ Supervised machine learning model, defining a decision boundary and then seeing what side of the boundary an unclassified point falls on. SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.

## Clustering

__K-Mean:__ Unsupervised machine learning model, using a defined number of cluster (k) and randomly placed centroid to cluster data. Inertia define the distance with associated centroids (lower is better).

__K-Means++:__ K-Means++ is an updated version of K-Means that aims to avoid the convergence and clustering problems by placing the initial centroids in a more effective way.
