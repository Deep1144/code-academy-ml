# Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' Theorem is the basis of a branch of statistics called Bayesian Statistics, where we take prior knowledge into account before calculating new probabilities.

This allows us to find narrow solutions from a huge universe of possibilities.

## Definition

Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the second event

If two events are independent then: P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)

A *prior* is an additional piece of information that tells us how likely an event is

A *frequentist* approach to statistics does not incorporate a prior

A *Bayesian* approach to statistics incorporates prior knowledge

*Bayes' Theorem* is the following: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
